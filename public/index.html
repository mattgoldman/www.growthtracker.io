							GrowthTracker allows you to integrate directly into your own app and start tracking anything you want. We handle all the calculations for compound growth based on what you tell us your goals are and display them in simple, beautiful graphs.

							GrowthTracker tracker tells you exactly what you need to do each day to hit your goals for the week. Based on your progress, your goals will be re-calculated on a weekly basis to help keep your team on track.

							If you're running growth hacking experiments, you'll be able to track the results and see how they affect your larger goals/funnels in GrowthTracker. You can pinpoint exactly what's been effective as well as what hasn't.

						<p>
							You'll be able to look back at your data and see how your growth curve has changed over the long-term.

						<h2>Why does compound growth matter?</h2>
						<p>Paul Graham explains it best: "When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is, sometimes they tell me 'We get about a hundred new customers a month'. <!--That's not a rate.--> What matters is <b>not</b> the absolute number of new customers, but the <i>ratio</i> of new customers to existing ones.</p>

						<p>If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every month, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is actually <b>decreasing</b>."

					<div class="six columns">
						  <h2>Why is compound growth so powerful?</h2>
							<p>The beautiful thing about compound growth is that the tiniest little changes can lead to HUGE long-term value. A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year.</p>

							<p>A company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x in a single year. If you're making $1000 a month and growing at 3% a week, in one year you'll be making $4,650 a month. In 3 years, that number will be $100,602 a month. <i>That's the power of compounding.</i></p>
